Standard terms and conditions

Anti slavery / Anti bribary content
-----------------------------------
We strive to be a great place to work for EverKnow people. We want our employees to be fully engaged with our Company and motivated to give their all and we want their contribution to be recognised and rewarded.
We will therefore not tolerate forced, bonded or compulsory labour, human trafficking and other kinds of slavery within our own operations or within our supply chain and are committed to taking appropriate steps to ensure that everyone who works for EverKnow – in any capacity – benefits from a working environment in which their fundamental rights and freedoms are respected.
We adopt procedures that contribute to ensuring modern slavery does not occur in our business or supply chains and we expect organisations with whom we do business to adopt and enforce policies to comply with the legislation.


Sustainability pledges: diversity / Carbon footprint etc
--------------------------------------------------------
We believe we can be a successful business and do good to protect our people and the planet for future generations to come.
We are motivated to drive change within our own organisation whilst working with our partners, our supply chain, and supporting our customers on their socially responsible journey through the technology we provide
